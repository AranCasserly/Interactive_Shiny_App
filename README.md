# Interactive Shiny App
This R Shiny app was created to observe and analyse the Maths Ed dataset for an assignment as part of the STAT40380 module in UCD.

This application can generate: <br />
An interactive table of uploaded data <br />
An interactive violin/boxplot of results achieved <br />
An interactive scatterplot of result achieved for each gender based on VLE usage <br />
An interactive bargraph of results achieved for each gender based on their big five personality factors <br />
An interactive bargraph of results achieved for each gender based on their approaches to learning

All plots have interactive labeling and can be exported as a PNG file.
